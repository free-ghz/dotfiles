" musho oct 2019. lets do this
" followed guides by Doug Black and a Marchgg
" looked at a bunch of other peoples configs as well

" to put vundle in the sacamophagus, i need to paste some lines here:

"
" ***************************** BEGIN VUNDLE
"

filetype off
" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()

" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

" add other plugins like this: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Plugin 'easymotion/vim-easymotion'
Plugin 'vim-airline/vim-airline'

" ie 'github-user/project'

" All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
call vundle#end()            " required
filetype plugin indent on    " required
" To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
"filetype plugin on
"
" Brief help
" :PluginList       - lists configured plugins
" :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just :PluginUpdate
" :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache
" :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to auto-approve removal
"
" see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ
" Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line

"
" ***************************** END VUNDLE
